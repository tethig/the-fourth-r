## Introduction
Welcome to the Dickins lab R learning resource. As well as being the [title of a novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fourth_%22R%22) "the fourth R" references the concept of the three Rs, that is: *R*eading, w*R*iting and a*R*ithmetic, skills considered essential for accessing wider learning. The [R language](https://www.r-project.org) arguably deserves a place in this list. R is a high-level language with great strengths in statistical calculation and graphics. Learning R will give you the ability to program a computer, analyse many types of data and represent your analyses using attractive and informative plots.

This page provides a starting point for R learning. It can be viewed online, but to follow along properly you also need to download a copy of the GitHub repository.

## Download a Copy
You may download a copy of this "repository" by clicking on [this link](https://github.com/tethig/the-fourth-r/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). This will download a copy of a folder called "the-fourth-r-main" on your computer. The folder is zipped and your browser is likely to have placed it in your "Downloads" folder. Please ensure you unzip its contents ("Extract All" if using Windows) and move it to a convenient location such as your Desktop.

Notes:
- Time Series Data: these data are from my fitness tracker and are in a JSON-like format. So this example, shows how to wrangle data, read JSON and handle themes and times in ggplot2.
- Heatmap Data: these data are similar to microarray data although they are smaller in extent and not derived from an experiment. Data from [this site](http://www.sbeams.org/sample_data/) [accessed 07/05/2015].

## Installing R
If you have your own computer it is easy to install R. You can do so via the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). To do this you can use your search engine to find "R" and from the R homepage choose a local mirror site ([direct link here](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)). This works for all major operating systems. Mac users may, however, also find nightly builds on [this bleeding-edge repository](https://mac.r-project.org). While R is all you need, I strongly recommend using an "Integrated Development Environment" (IDE) while you learn. This is a piece of software that allows you to see extra information (such as what's in the computer memory, help pages and plots) in an organised layout on your screen. Probably the most popular IDE, and the one I recommend, is the [RStudio Open Source Edition](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

If you are a power user and you want to do some additional things with R, you may find my [tips and tricks repository](https://github.com/tethig/turbo-spoon) helpful.
